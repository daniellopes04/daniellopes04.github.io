## A little about me

Hi! My name is Daniel de Sousa and I'm a Software Engineer Intern, on his way to a Junior position. My interests include web development and development in general, besides books, music and writing poetry. I also like to cuddle my cats and develop games on my free time.

- Javascript
- Python (Flask)
- Vue.js (Quasar Framework)
- Java (SpringBoot)
- PHP (Laravel)
