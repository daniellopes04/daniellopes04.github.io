Hi! My name is Daniel de Sousa and I'm a Software Engineer Intern, on his way to a Junior position. I like to cuddle my cats and develop games on my free time.

My interests include web development and development in general, besides books, music and writing poetry. 

Some of the technologies that I've worked with are: Python, Quasar and Vue.js, Java with SpringBoot, Docker and more.
